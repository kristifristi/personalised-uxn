# Uxn

a fork of the original, found [here](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn)
(all the important info about installation and stuff is there too)

# Changes

- you can now change the controller button bindings with the `-c` flag (more info in the command line)
- the foreground and background have their own pixel buffers, so changing the screen colors between draw commands keeps the old colours on the screen
